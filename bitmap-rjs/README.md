# Description

In our assignment we initially read a file and set if statements to see if the file was a bitmap. If the file was not a bitmap it returns an error specifying why. If it is a valid bitmap file it console logs that is reading the file. A constructor is made of the MetaData which defines the data parameter of the file header, which the file header tells the application detailed information about the file. Then we create a new file header data and create let variables that state the values in bytes of the file structure of the bitmap. We extract the color table from buffer to array. After we set where in the array can you find the red value, blue value, green value, invert, and grayscale. Following we pushed the color table array back into the color table buffer and recombine all four buffers of the file. A new file path is made. We then write a new file and return back the file header object containing the data values if it successful with a verifier number if not it will return an error. The file path for the picture and either toRed, toBlue, toGreen, invert or greyscale needs to be typed in the CLI (ex: node index.js ./assets/bitmap.bmp.toRed).
